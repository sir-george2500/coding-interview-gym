# Binary Search

## Intuition

Binary search is an efficient array search algorithm. It works by narrowing down the search range by half each time. If you have looked up a word in a physical dictionary, you've already used binary search in real life. Let's look at a simple example:

Given a sorted array of integers and an integer called `target`, find the element that equals the target and return its index. If the element is not found, return `-1`.

The key observation here is that the array is sorted. We pick a random element in the array and compare it to the target.

- If we happen to pick the element that equals the target (how lucky!), then bingo. We don't need to do any more work; we return its index.
- If the element is **smaller** than the target, then we know the target cannot be found in the section to the left of the current element, since everything to the left is even smaller. So, we discard the current element and everything on the left from the search range.
- If the element is **larger** than the target, then we know the target cannot be found in the section to the right of the current element, since everything to the right is even larger. So, we discard the current element and everything on the right from the search range.

We repeat this process until we find the target. Instead of picking a random element, we always pick the **middle element** in the current search range. This way, we can discard half of the options and shrink the search range by half each time. This gives us **O(log(N))** runtime.

This idea can be implemented both **iteratively** and **recursively**. However, the major difference is that the **iterative** version of binary search uses **O(1) memory** while the **recursive** version uses **O(log(N)) memory**.
